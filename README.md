Hello! I'm a guy doing something he hopes he knows. I'm also known as "quarto hotline" by some of my friends, as I'd help them with writing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) stuff.

On my profile you'll find all sorts of repositories, which will unfortunately get indexed by a bajillion of AI software by the bajillion of startups *specializing in AI* to create the absolute shithole of an "AI assistant", because I accepted the ToS without actually reading it and I *trust* mega corporation like a complete sellout.

**Current Goal**: no committing on Saturday & Sunday (it's a weekend for god sake)
